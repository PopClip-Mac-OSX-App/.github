## Overview  

PopClip for Mac is a lightweight yet powerful productivity enhancer that instantly appears when you select text, offering one-click access to a wide variety of actions. Inspired by the iOS-style pop-up menu, PopClip brings that same smooth experience to macOS — allowing users to copy, paste, search, translate, and perform hundreds of other actions with remarkable ease.  

The app seamlessly integrates with macOS and is designed to boost efficiency for writers, developers, researchers, and everyday users. Whether you want to define a word, open a URL, correct text capitalization, or send selected text to another app, PopClip makes it all accessible through a simple, context-aware popup. It works system-wide, meaning that nearly any text you highlight — in browsers, documents, or chat apps — can be instantly acted upon.  

One of PopClip’s strongest advantages is its extensibility. It supports over 200 user-created extensions that add new features and integrations with popular tools like Evernote, Grammarly, Notion, ChatGPT, and more. Users can even create their own extensions using simple scripting, allowing PopClip to adapt perfectly to any workflow.  

Recent updates have further improved its macOS optimization, offering full support for Apple Silicon, dark mode, and new automation triggers. PopClip is ideal for anyone looking to save time on repetitive text actions and create a more fluid, intuitive interaction with their Mac.
